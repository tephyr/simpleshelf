  element definition::

    {date: yyyy-mm-dd, action: text}

  examples::

    {date: '2012-01-01',          action: 'book.read.started'}
    {date: '2012-01-08',          action: 'book.read.finished'}

Constants
+++++++++
Constants in CouchDB are tricky: CouchDB does not allow access to other documents when saving one, to preserve atomicity.  Any list of acceptable values must be available to the validation routine and the creation code.  The following lists are allowable sets of values for particular fields in the schema.

book/activities/action
----------------------
- book.added
- book.read.started
- book.read.finished
- book.read.stopped
- search.requested
- search.finished

book/status/read
----------------
- to.read (*adds book.read.queued to actions*)
- reading (*adds book.read.started to actions*)
- finished (*adds book.read.finished to actions*)
- abandoned (*adds book.read.stopped to actions*)
- reference

book/status/ownership
---------------------
- personal
- library
- on.loan
- loaned.out
- on.order
